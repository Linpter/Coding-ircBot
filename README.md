This is a little script i've made for a homework.

To use it you need to :
  1- Execute the file in your terminal.
  2- Then open your browser, go to this website : webchat.freenode.net
  3- Enter your nickname and put "##bot-testing" in the channel
  4- Write "Hi Pickle Rick !" and he will talk to you back
  
  For now, it is all it does !
